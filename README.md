# FWSMAS
Experiment code for Forward secure multi-user aggregate signature scheme[1]. 
It utilizes TurboPlonk[2] as a building block for the zero-knowledge proof systems.

The algorithm has O(1) metric in Setup,Update,Sign,Verify and supports an aggregation of multi user signatures with different messages and time periods.
